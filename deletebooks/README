The only thing you need to do is to edit the deletelist.csv file, just add the unique entries in a column that you are getting 
rid of in the database.
Note: only entries from one column in the database is enough to find the records and delete them. 
 

After you are done with editting the CSV file, just run the python code, then the records will be erased from the database. 

$ python deletebooks.py
