This file provides specific information on how to use the deletebook python script to delete books from the database

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The only thing you need to do is to edit the deletelist.csv file, just add all the book IDs for the books you are getting 
rid of in the database
NOTE: Most important thing is the book ID, when the ID is single digit, there has to be a 0(zero) before it. Such as A-07 or 
it will NOT work. 

After you are done with editting the CSV file, just run the python code, then the book records will be erased from the db. 

$ python deletebooks.py
